This is a tool I really need right now, and which should be dead simple to
write, so I thought this would be a good task to throw to an AI. Turns out
GPT-4o or whatever copilot uses is godawful at writing bash scripts. I rewrote
half the code, it generated, the other half still does not work. Unless your job
is to write generic static react sites, you are safe from vibe coders for now.
